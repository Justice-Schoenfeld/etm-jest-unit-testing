# Main Info
This code is structured similar to how we use it in ETM. The main html file is `runner.html` and the main javascript code is `testfile.js`. There is no main xml file like we use in our widgets, instead you will need the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey (v5.7.9 as of May 31, 2024). You can then run Live Server on the html file and it will launch the html inside of your default browser, to launch there is a "Go Live" button in the bottorm right corner of vs code when in the html file.
